# Community [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jthistle/community.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jthistle/community)
A community simulator written in Python.

I'll write a proper explanation of what this is and how it works soon, watch/star to stay updated.

## Install instructions
### Requirements
Python 3.6+ recommended.
This program requires the `names` python page and `tkinter`.

Install names through pip with:

	python3 -m pip install names

If tkinter isn't installed, install it.

Linux:
	
	sudo apt-get install python3-tk

Then, just run `main.py` and hey presto, it should work.

Please report any issues found to the tracker.
